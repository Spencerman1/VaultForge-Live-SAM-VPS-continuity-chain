Excellent — moving forward exactly as you requested.  
Here is **MODULE 2**, crafted for the **LIVE (public) repo**, written in clean, investor‑ready language, and structured to fit directly into your fundraising site or README.

As always, this contains **no private formulas**, **no internal mechanics**, and **no sensitive logic** — only the public‑facing licensing architecture.

# 🔷 **MODULE 2 — Public Licensing Overview (LIVE Repo)**

Vault Forge Live operates on a **creator‑first, opt‑in licensing framework** designed to protect authorship, reward contribution, and enable ethical participation in the innovation economy.  
This licensing model applies across ideas, prototypes, datasets, relics, and innovation channels.

---

# 📝 **Vault Forge Live — Licensing Overview**

Vault Forge Live uses a **transparent, opt‑in licensing system** that allows creators, studios, and enterprises to control how their work is used within the ecosystem.  
The platform supports multiple licensing paths, each designed to maximize creator value while maintaining ecosystem integrity.

---

## 🔹 **1. Idea Licensing**
Creators can license ideas through Innovation Channels as:

- **Open Relics** — publicly viewable, purchasable, and remixable  
- **Protected Relics** — viewable but not reusable without permission  
- **Exclusive Rights** — full ownership transferred to a buyer  

This ensures creators retain control over how their intellectual property evolves.

---

## 🔹 **2. Prototype Licensing**
Prototypes can be licensed for:

- **Demonstration use**  
- **Commercial development**  
- **Enterprise integration**  
- **Co‑creation rights**  

Creators choose the level of access and usage rights.

---

## 🔹 **3. Dataset Licensing**
The AI Dataset Exchange supports:

- **Opt‑in dataset uploads**  
- **Royalty‑based licensing**  
- **Enterprise access agreements**  
- **Creator‑controlled usage permissions**  

This ensures datasets are used ethically, transparently, and with compensation.

---

## 🔹 **4. Relic Licensing**
Every artifact minted as a relic includes:

- **Timestamped authorship**  
- **Usage rights**  
- **Transferability**  
- **Commercial permissions**  

Relics can be sold, auctioned, or licensed for derivative works.

---

## 🔹 **5. Sponsorship Licensing**
Brands can license:

- **Challenge prompts**  
- **Innovation rights**  
- **Station sponsorships**  
- **Relic rewards**  

This creates a structured, transparent relationship between creators and sponsors.

---

## 🔹 **6. Enterprise Licensing**
Enterprises can license:

- **Datasets**  
- **Innovation channels**  
- **Creator time blocks**  
- **Governance access**  
- **Private demonstrations**  

This is the highest tier of licensing and supports large‑scale integration.

---

# 🧭 **Purpose of This Module**
This module is designed to:

- appear in the **public README**  
- anchor the **Licensing** section of your fundraising site  
- show investors and creators that Vault Forge Live has a **mature, ethical licensing framework**  
- establish **category legitimacy**  
- avoid revealing any private mechanics or internal formulas
