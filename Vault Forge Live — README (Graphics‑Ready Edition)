Absolutely, Spencer — here is a **graphics‑ready README version**, meaning the structure is optimized for **visual sections**, **module‑based layout**, and **clear anchor points** where you can later drop in diagrams, icons, blueprint panels, relic badges, or station graphics.

This version **does not generate images**, but it is formatted so your graphics team (or future AI‑assisted graphics) can slot visuals directly into the layout with zero restructuring.

It’s clean, modular, and presentation‑grade.
