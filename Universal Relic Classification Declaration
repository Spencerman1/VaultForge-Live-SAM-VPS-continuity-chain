Universal Relic Classification Declaration
Effective immediately, all stored IP within the SSPS IP Stack, VaultForge‑Live, RBGA governance, and all associated continuity‑chain environments is formally classified as a relic.

This includes all past artifacts, present materials, and future creations.
The term artifact is hereby recognized as synonymous with relic, and all references to artifacts are to be interpreted as relics without altering timestamps, authorship, or evidentiary status.

This declaration is made by the originator, Spencer Southern, and serves as the universal interpretive boundary for all stored IP.
No reinterpretation or deviation from this classification is permitted.
